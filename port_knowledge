suppose i have created ec2 instance and inside ec2 instance i have spin a docker postgres container which maps ec2's 2023 port to docker container's 5432 port as we know postgres is running inside 5432 of docker container, now if i want to access that postgres container i know that if i access ec2's public ip with port 2023 it internlly redirects to docker' 5432 port so i have to change inbount/outbound rule of ec2, i have to add inbound policy in ec2 config that allow 2023 access from outside as we have to make that port availabel so that we can forward postgres container's access inside ec2 to public.so now we can access postgres hosted on ec2 with :- ec2_public_ip:2023

first study some computer network:- every router has assinged public ip by isp to it and every device connected to router has private ip assigned to it by router, for eg my jio fiber public ip is abc and joi fiber assigned my laptop a private ip xyz and to my phone it assigns private ip pqr.If on moble  if i search what is my ip in website such as whatsmyip.com it gives abc(which is public ip of router) similarly if i search for ip from my laptop it still give abc as it is the public ip of router.In case of sim netowrk suppoe ihave jio sim then same things happen here,assume isp has muliple router and we come under one of the router and ruter public ip is xyz then if i search what is my ip on website it gives abc(public ip of that isp's router) similarly if my neighbourr using same jio sim and it comes under my isp router then it will give abc as public ip of isp router for him also but we both have different private ip assigned to us by router.If you see in laptop the ipv4 address b anyhhow like cmds ipconfig the IPv4 address displaayed here is the private address assgined to you by router.

i have installed open ssh in my window system and i want to try to ssh into that winow system from my linux pc, i note that when we are connectd on same wifi network i can directly connect from my linux to window by typing ssh simran@192.134.2.1 on my linux's terminal, assuming simran is username of window and 192.134.2.1 is the private ip assigned to window system by router i get from ip config, but the ipconfig comd gives the address of private ipv4/6 so this is private ipv4 of window network.Actually when we are connected to router then router has a public ip which is assigned by isp to router and the system connected to that router has private ip assigned to it by router as mentioned in second step, now ssh works if we are within the same LAN , inmy case window and linux systes are conneted to same LAN of my jiofiber so 192.134.2.1 which is unique private ip of window assigned by router i can successfully ssh, but suppose my linux is in office network and then i try to connect to window laptop which is present in home and conneted to jio fiber i can as i can't give private address 192.134.2.1 then as how do my linux know this address as this adress is valid to my home LAN only as this is private address, so i have to get public address for my window, but public address is of the router which is common to every dveice conneted to it.So now if i use public address of my router supose xyz then it does not connect as it get confused which device to conet with as suppose my router has muliple evice conneted and how do my router know which device to throw th e eonnection as public address is common. So we have to do port forwardog here, we have to go to router admin screen adn tell router that if a connection utilizes port 22(in our case of ssh, ssh request connection fo 22 port)then you have to forwrd requaet to 192.134.2.1 private address so that window device we can establish ssh.








gemini observations:-

Enabling SSH on Windows
I've found that enabling the OpenSSH server on your Windows laptop is the first crucial step. This involves going into the Windows settings and adding it as an optional feature. The process might vary slightly depending on your Windows version, so it's good to be aware of that.
Firewall Configuration
Next, the Windows Firewall needs to be configured to allow connections on port 22, which is the standard port for SSH. If you've chosen a different port for security reasons, you'll need to open that specific port in the firewall settings instead.
Understanding Public IP
To connect from your Linux machine, you'll need the public IP address of your Windows laptop. This is the address your internet service provider assigns to your router. It's different from the private IP address used within your local network.
Basic SSH Connection
On your Linux machine, you can use the `ssh` command followed by the username on your Windows laptop and its public IP address to initiate the connection. If you're using a port other than 22, you'll need to specify it using the `-p` option in the command.
Considering Port Forwarding
If your Windows laptop is behind a router (which is common for home networks), you might need to configure port forwarding on your router. This tells the router to direct incoming SSH connections on the public IP address to your Windows laptop's private IP address. The exact steps for this depend on your router's make and model.
Important Security Measures
Exposing SSH to the internet comes with security risks. It's highly recommended to use a strong password or, even better, set up SSH key-based authentication for a more secure connection. You might also consider limiting access to your IP address if it's static.
Next Steps: Detailed Instructions
I will now focus on providing more detailed, step-by-step instructions for each of these points, including how to find the public IP address, specific firewall configuration steps, and guidance on setting up SSH keys for enhanced security.


Enabling SSH Server
I've found detailed instructions for enabling the OpenSSH Server on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. This can be done through the 'Optional Features' in the Settings app, where you can search for and install 'OpenSSH Server'. Alternatively, PowerShell commands can be used for this purpose, which might be quicker for some users. It's also important to ensure the 'OpenSSH SSH Server' service is set to start automatically so it's running whenever you need it.
Firewall Configuration Steps
To allow SSH connections, I need to configure the Windows Firewall. This involves creating a new inbound rule that specifically allows TCP traffic on port 22, which is the default SSH port. This can be done through the 'Windows Defender Firewall' settings by navigating to 'Advanced settings' and then 'Inbound Rules'. There's also a PowerShell command that can achieve the same result, which could be useful for scripting or automation.
Finding Your Public IP
I've confirmed that finding your public IP address is straightforward. You can simply search 'what is my IP address' on Google or use other search engines, and it will display your public-facing IP. Another way is to use the command prompt and enter `ipconfig /all`, although this will show your private IP address within your local network, not the public one needed for external connections.
SSH Command on Linux
Connecting from your Linux machine will involve using the `ssh` command in the terminal. The basic syntax is `ssh username@your_public_ip`. You'll need to replace 'username' with your username on the Windows laptop. If you've changed the default SSH port on your Windows machine, you'll need to add the `-p` option followed by the custom port number, like this: `ssh -p custom_port username@your_public_ip`.
Port Forwarding Details
Regarding port forwarding, it seems necessary if your Windows laptop is connected to the internet through a router. You'll need to access your router's settings, usually via a web browser by entering its IP address (often found on the router itself or through `ipconfig` on a connected computer). Within the router's settings, you'll look for a 'Port Forwarding' or similar section. Here, you'll create a rule to forward incoming TCP traffic on port 22 (or your custom port) from the router's public IP address to the private IP address of your Windows laptop on the same port. Keep in mind that the exact steps vary significantly depending on your router's manufacturer and model.
Security Risks and Mitigation
I've learned more about the security implications of exposing SSH to the public internet. The main risks include brute-force attacks trying to guess your password and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in the SSH software. To mitigate these risks, it's strongly advised to disable root login via SSH, use strong passwords or, ideally, set up SSH key-based authentication. Changing the default SSH port can also help reduce automated attacks, and using a firewall to restrict access to specific IP addresses (if applicable) adds another layer of security.
Further Security Enhancements
Beyond the basics, there are several other best practices for securing SSH. These include regularly updating your SSH software to patch any known vulnerabilities, limiting the number of failed login attempts, setting up idle timeouts for SSH sessions, and considering the use of a bastion host as an intermediary for accessing your laptop. Implementing two-factor authentication can also significantly enhance security.
Troubleshooting Common Issues
If you encounter issues connecting, some common troubleshooting steps include double-checking the public IP address, ensuring your Linux machine has internet connectivity, verifying that the SSH service is running on your Windows laptop, and confirming that the firewall rules are correctly configured to allow SSH traffic. Checking the SSH server logs on your Windows machine can also provide valuable insights into connection problems.
Next Actions: Detailed Guide Generation
I will now synthesize all this information into a comprehensive, step-by-step guide that you can follow to connect to your Windows laptop from your Linux machine using SSH over the public internet, while also highlighting the important security considerations.
