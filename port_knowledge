suppose i have created ec2 instance and inside ec2 instance i have spin a docker postgres container which maps ec2's 2023 port to docker container's 5432 port as we know postgres is running inside 5432 of docker container, now if i want to access that postgres container i know that if i access ec2's public ip with port 2023 it internlly redirects to docker' 5432 port so i have to change inbount/outbound rule of ec2, i have to add inbound policy in ec2 config that allow 2023 access from outside as we have to make that port availabel so that we can forward postgres container's access inside ec2 to public.so now we can access postgres hosted on ec2 with :- ec2_public_ip:2023

first study some computer network:- every router has assinged public ip by isp to it and every device connected to router has private ip assigned to it by router, for eg my jio fiber public ip is abc and joi fiber assigned my laptop a private ip xyz and to my phone it assigns private ip pqr.If on moble  if i search what is my ip in website such as whatsmyip.com it gives abc(which is public ip of router) similarly if i search for ip from my laptop it still give abc as it is the public ip of router.In case of sim netowrk suppoe ihave jio sim then same things happen here,assume isp has muliple router and we come under one of the router and ruter public ip is xyz then if i search what is my ip on website it gives abc(public ip of that isp's router) similarly if my neighbourr using same jio sim and it comes under my isp router then it will give abc as public ip of isp router for him also but we both have different private ip assigned to us by router.If you see in laptop the ipv4 address b anyhhow like cmds ipconfig the IPv4 address displaayed here is the private address assgined to you by router.

i have installed open ssh in my window system and i want to try to ssh into that winow system from my linux pc, i note that when we are connectd on same wifi network i can directly connect from my linux to window by typing ssh simran@192.134.2.1 on my linux's terminal, assuming simran is username of window and 192.134.2.1 is the private ip assigned to window system by router i get from ip config, but the ipconfig comd gives the address of private ipv4/6 so this is private ipv4 of window network.Actually when we are connected to router then router has a public ip which is assigned by isp to router and the system connected to that router has private ip assigned to it by router as mentioned in second step, now ssh works if we are within the same LAN , inmy case window and linux systes are conneted to same LAN of my jiofiber so 192.134.2.1 which is unique private ip of window assigned by router i can successfully ssh, but suppose my linux is in office network and then i try to connect to window laptop which is present in home and conneted to jio fiber i can as i can't give private address 192.134.2.1 then as how do my linux know this address as this adress is valid to my home LAN only as this is private address, so i have to get public address for my window, but public address is of the router which is common to every dveice conneted to it.So now if i use public address of my router supose xyz then it does not connect as it get confused which device to conet with as suppose my router has muliple evice conneted and how do my router know which device to throw th e eonnection as public address is common. So we have to do port forwardog here, we have to go to router admin screen adn tell router that if a connection utilizes port 22(in our case of ssh, ssh request connection fo 22 port)then you have to forwrd requaet to 192.134.2.1 private address so that window device we can establish ssh.
