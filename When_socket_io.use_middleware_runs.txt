Great question! Let me clarify exactly when io.use() middleware runs:
io.use() runs ONLY during connection establishment
io.use() middleware runs before io.on('connection') but NOT before individual event listeners like your meow event.
Here's the exact flow:
javascript// Server side
io.use((socket, next) => {
  console.log('1. io.use middleware - runs ONLY during connection');
  next();
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('2. Connection established');
  
  socket.on('meow', (data) => {
    console.log('3. Meow event handler - io.use does NOT run before this');
  });
});
javascript// Client side
const socket = io();
// 1. io.use middleware runs here
// 2. connection event fires

socket.emit('meow', 'data'); // io.use does NOT run here
For per-event middleware, use socket.use()
If you want middleware to run before every event (including your meow event), use socket.use():
javascriptio.use((socket, next) => {
  console.log('Connection middleware');
  next();
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // This runs before EVERY event on this socket
  socket.use((packet, next) => {
    console.log('Event middleware - runs before meow, bark, etc.');
    console.log('Event name:', packet[0]); // 'meow'
    console.log('Event data:', packet[1]); // your data
    next();
  });
  
  socket.on('meow', (data) => {
    console.log('Meow handler');
  });
  
  socket.on('bark', (data) => {
    console.log('Bark handler');
  });
});
Complete timeline:

Client connects → io.use() middleware runs
Connection accepted → io.on('connection') callback runs
Client emits 'meow' → socket.use() middleware runs → socket.on('meow') handler runs
Client emits 'bark' → socket.use() middleware runs → socket.on('bark') handler runs

So to answer your question directly: io.use() does NOT run before your meow listener's callback. It only runs once during the initial connection handshake.
